A tool that discovers high-quality Hacker News posts from low-karma accounts that would otherwise be overlooked.

## Overview

The HN Hidden Gems Finder helps surface excellent content from new or low-karma Hacker News users that often gets buried despite being valuable. This addresses the problem where great "Show HN" posts and discussions get no traction simply because the author doesn't have established karma.

## Features

- **Real-time Hidden Gems Feed**: Continuously discovers overlooked quality posts (every 5 minutes)
- **Automated Background Services**: 
  - **Post Collection**: Automatic discovery and analysis with configurable intervals (no Redis required)
  - **Hall of Fame Monitoring**: Tracks gems that achieve success and automatically promotes them (every 6 hours)
  - **Super Gems Analysis**: AI-powered deep analysis of top gems using Google Gemini with user-friendly visual scoring (every 6 hours)
- **Hall of Fame**: Automated tracking of discovered gems that later became popular (≥100 points)
- **Success Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of discovery accuracy and timing
- **Quality Analysis**: AI-powered content analysis to identify technical depth and originality
- **Anti-spam Protection**: Advanced filtering to maintain high quality
- **Duplicate Detection**: Intelligent duplicate post detection and filtering to prevent spam and content recycling
- **Visual Scoring System**: User-friendly star ratings and professional dot indicators instead of intimidating numerical scores
- **Knowledge-Aware AI**: Smart evaluation system that avoids penalizing posts for recent technology releases
- **Time-based Collection**: Intelligent collection that only processes posts from specified time windows

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment** (optional):
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env to customize settings
   ```

3. **Initialize Database**
   ```bash
   python -m hn_hidden_gems.models.init_db
   ```

4. **Configure Collection Service (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # Set collection interval (default: 5 minutes, 0 to disable)
   export POST_COLLECTION_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5
   ```

5. **Run Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   The application automatically starts all background services:
   - **Post Collection**: Discovers new gems every 5 minutes
   - **Hall of Fame Monitoring**: Checks for gem success every 6 hours
   - **Super Gems Analysis**: Deep AI analysis of top gems every 6 hours

## Architecture

The system uses the official Hacker News API for all data collection:
- **HN Firebase API**: Real-time updates with no rate limits

Key components:
- **Data Collection**: Automatic background collection of HN new posts
- **Quality Analysis**: AI-powered content evaluation with spam detection
- **Duplicate Detection**: Advanced duplicate post filtering using URL normalization, content similarity analysis, and same-author detection
- **Super Gems Analysis**: Advanced AI evaluation with visual scoring and knowledge-aware assessments
- **Storage**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Web Interface**: Flask application with real-time updates
- **Background Service**: APScheduler-based in-process collection (no Redis required)
- **Time-based Processing**: Collects only posts from specified time windows

## Documentation

For detailed technical documentation on the algorithms:

📖 **[Hidden Gems Detection Algorithm](docs/HIDDEN_GEMS_DETECTION.md)** - Complete documentation of the initial quality analysis system that identifies hidden gems from low-karma authors, including scoring methodology, spam detection, and Live Feed generation.

🔬 **[Super Gems Analysis Algorithm](docs/SUPER_GEMS_ALGORITHM.md)** - In-depth explanation of the advanced LLM-powered analysis system, including prompt engineering, scoring criteria, and quality assurance measures.

### Super Gems Analysis System

The Super Gems feature provides comprehensive AI-powered analysis of top hidden gems:

**Visual Scoring System:**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Star ratings** for overall quality (instead of intimidating numerical scores)
- **Professional dot indicators** for detailed metrics:
  - ●●●● Exceptional (91-100%)
  - ●●● Excellent (76-90%)
  - ●● Good (51-75%)
  - ● Basic (0-50%)

**Smart AI Analysis:**
- **Knowledge-aware evaluation** that doesn't penalize posts for recent technology releases
- **Technical merit focus** over factual verification for emerging technologies
- **Automatic bias correction** for outdated knowledge assumptions
- **Comprehensive GitHub integration** for code quality assessment

**Analysis Dimensions:**
- Technical Innovation
- Problem Significance  
- Implementation Quality
- Community Value
- Uniqueness Score

**Output Formats:**
- **super-gems.html**: Clean, public-friendly version without ratings (maintains ranking order)
- **super-gems-ratings.html**: Internal version with full visual scoring system
- **super-gems.json**: JSON API data with all analysis details

### Duplicate Detection System

The application includes a comprehensive duplicate detection system to maintain content quality:

**Detection Methods:**
- **URL-based**: Detects identical URLs after normalization (removes tracking parameters, trailing slashes, etc.)
- **Content similarity**: Uses sequence matching to identify posts with similar titles and content (configurable thresholds)
- **Same-author detection**: Identifies users posting similar content multiple times (spam behavior)
- **Title normalization**: Removes common HN prefixes ("Ask HN:", "Show HN:") and punctuation for better matching

**Integration Points:**
- **Post Collection**: Automatically checks for duplicates before saving new posts
- **Super Gems Analysis**: Filters out duplicates before expensive LLM analysis
- **Database Management**: Provides tools to find, mark, and clean up duplicate posts

**Quality Preservation:**
- Always keeps the **earlier post** (lower HN ID) or **higher quality post** (better gem score)
- Marks duplicates as spam rather than deleting them
- Maintains traceability of duplicate detection decisions

**Performance Impact:**
- Cleaned up 278 existing duplicate posts across 112 URLs in initial deployment
- Significantly reduces noise and improves content quality in hidden gems feed
- Prevents spam behavior where users post the same content multiple times
